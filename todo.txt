UI LOW PRIORITY
Save your backup phrase screen while loading should be fixed size, continue button should be disabled to prevent advancing
ui tweaks (restore height spacing, background coloring, max page height, etc)
enter key invokes continue buttons
do not confirm losing sync progress?
remove disabled icon/attribute on buttons (only styled and non-clickable)
button text not highlightable

TX GENERATION
tps should be factor in computing how many outputs to split; tweak output growth; not how many are currently available but how many will be available after they unlock
tx generator's listener has status message which should be updated to button so status reflects what's happening instead of what happened
num blocks to next/last unlock based on 10 confirmations; base on unlock height for mined txs
balance is incorrect after first tx
numBlocksToNext/LastUnlock not computed until first block or transaction, but not on initial main
resume sending transactions on notification of available balance
